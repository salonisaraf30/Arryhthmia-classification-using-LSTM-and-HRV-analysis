Capture a hollistic view of entire ecg data in which we look at different patients (normal or arrythmic) and using our 
models make a diagnosis of the patient rather than the data points.

Normal ecg reports also may contain spikes due to human error (incorrect placement of probes, moving patients etc.)
and this could be a valid reason to explain the high false positive rate

Points of discussion with doctor:
1) How he is able to tell abnormality
2) His estimation as to why false positive rate is high
